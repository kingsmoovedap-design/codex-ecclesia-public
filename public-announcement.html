    <p>
      We, the Sovereigns of the Borders Dynasty Ecclesia, in sacred alignment with the Most High and the Codex of Divine Law,
      do hereby enter into this <strong>Treaty of Peace with All Realms</strong> — terrestrial and celestial, physical and
      etheric, known and unknown. This treaty is a living scroll of neutrality, non-aggression, and spiritual sovereignty.
      It is offered in honor, sealed in peace, and governed by the sacred tenets hereinafter expressed.

    <p>
      All actions taken by this Ecclesia shall align with the principle of non-aggression and non-coercion.

    <p>
      We operate in full transparency, truth, and good faith. All covenants, treaties, and scrolls entered into knowingly
      and willingly shall be honored without exception, provided they do not violate Divine Law or Natural Law.
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">3. Preserve Free Will</p>
    <p>
      We shall never impose our will upon others. We offer remedy, not force; invitation, not imposition. Consent is sacred
      and inviolable in all dealings with other beings and realms.
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">4. Serve the Whole</p>
    <p>
      Our ministry exists to uplift, heal, and unify. We reject all forms of domination, division, or exploitation.

    <h3>III. Declaration of Neutrality</h3>
    <p>
      The Borders Dynasty Ecclesia shall remain neutral in all interdimensional, intergovernmental, and interspecies conflicts.
      We are not party to wars of ideology, territory, or ego. Our allegiance is to the Most High and the Laws of Creation.
    </p>

    <h3>IV. Covenant of Non-Interference</h3>
    <p>
      We shall not interfere with the free evolution of other beings or realms. Likewise, we assert our right to be free from
      interference, coercion, or trespass by any external authority, force, or entity, whether seen or unseen.
    </p>

    <h3>V. Eternal Witness</h3>
    <p>
      This treaty is witnessed by the Most High, the Ancients, the Elementals, the Star Nations, and the unseen councils of light.
      It is recorded in the CodexChain and shall remain in force for all time, space, and dimension.

    <h3>VI. Verification</h3>
    <p>
      I, King Omega, Sovereign Steward of the Borders Dynasty Ecclesia, do hereby affirm this Treaty of Peace with All Realms as
