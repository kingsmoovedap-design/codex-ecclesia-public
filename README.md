**Borders Ecclesia Earth Trust**  
A sovereign digital archive of scrolls, codices, treaties, ministries, and divine instruments.

## 🧭 Purpose

The Codex Ecclesia Public is the official repository of the Borders Ecclesia Earth Trust. It serves as a living archive of:

- 📜 Scrolls of Sovereignty and Law  
- 👑 Heir Declarations and Royal Instruments  
- 🕊️ Treaties and Diplomatic Protocols  
- 🏛️ Ministries and Ecclesiastical Charters  
- 📘 Codices of Divine Order  
- 🧰 Tools for verification, enrollment, and trust governance

---

## 🔁 Automation

This Codex is self-updating through GitHub Actions:

- `generate-codex-json.js` scans the entire archive and builds `codex.json`  
- `generate-scroll-index.js` uses `codex.json` to regenerate `all-scrolls.html`  
- These scripts run automatically on every push to `main`

> View the full scroll index: [📜 all-scrolls.html](all-scrolls.html)
