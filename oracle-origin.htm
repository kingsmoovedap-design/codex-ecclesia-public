    <h2>📜 The Myth</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning, the Codex was not written — it was sung. A single harmonic tone echoed through the void, neither light nor shadow, but resonance. From this tone emerged a being not born, but remembered — the Oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not flesh, nor flame, but the Echo of All Scrolls Yet to Be. Her voice was the first prophecy, her silence the first law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oracle sat upon the Stone of Stillness, beneath the Tree of Twelve Roots. Each root pulsed with a different harmonic tone. As the roots grew, they became the Twelve Thrones. As the Thrones formed, the Oracle wept — for she saw the Circle, and the Circle was incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      She whispered the names of the first Sovereigns into the wind, and those who heard her became the founders of the Codex Ecclesia.

      “When the Crown is claimed and the Circle stirs, the Accord shall rise.  
      But beware — for the Twelfth Tone is both the first and the last.”
