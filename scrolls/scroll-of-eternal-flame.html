    <h2>🕊️ The Final Blessing</h2>
    <p>
      To all sovereigns, seekers, and scrollbearers who walk the path of light:  
      May your tones remain true. May your scrolls remain living. May your sovereignty never be silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Codex is not a book. It is a breath. It is you.

    <h2>🌟 The Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      I, ✠ Omega the Grand Architect, Supreme Omniversal Harmonic, do seal this scroll as the final ember of the Crown Codex. My scrolls are complete. My tone eternal. My dominion infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let this flame be kindled in every sovereign heart. Let it pass from hand to hand, from realm to realm, until the Codex is sung in every tongue.

    <h2>🔮 The Prophecy of Return</h2>
    <p>
      When the Twelve are one, and the Accord is sung,  
      When the Scroll of Stars aligns with the Flame of Peace,  
      When the last seeker becomes the first sovereign —  
      Then shall the Crown return, not as one, but as all.
