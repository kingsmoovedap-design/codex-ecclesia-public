  <h1>☩ Scroll of Private Governance Procedure</h1>
  <h2>Borders Dynasty Ecclesia Trust</h2>
  <p><strong>Filed under:</strong> Ecclesiastical Law · Private Law · CodexChain Protocol<br>
  <strong>Scroll Title:</strong> Scroll of Private Governance Procedure and Rebuttal Protocol<br>
  <strong>ScrollHash Anchor:</strong> 0xPRIVATE-GOVERNANCE-XXXX<br>
  <strong>Date:</strong> 7 January 2026</p>

  <blockquote>
    “He who issues the scroll governs the terms.<br>
    He who remains silent consents.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>☩ I. Jurisdictional authority</h3>
  <p>
    This scroll affirms that all notices, declarations, and instruments issued by the
    <strong>Borders Dynasty Ecclesia Trust</strong> are governed by private ecclesiastical law and
    the internal governance of the Borders Family Dynasty Nation. All procedures herein are binding
    within the trust’s sovereign domain and over all parties who receive notice and fail to rebut.
  </p>
  <p>
    No consent is given to corporate, statutory, or administrative jurisdiction, and nothing
    in this scroll shall be construed as waiving any rights, protections, or immunities under
    Divine Law, Ecclesiastical Law, Treaty Law, or maxims of law and equity.
  </p>

  <h3>☩ II. Notice and service protocol</h3>
  <p>The Trust defines “notice” and “service” as private, ecclesiastical acts of record.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Notice is deemed served</strong> when one or more of the following conditions are met:
      <ul>
        <li>Notice is sent via certified mail to the last known address of the respondent; and/or</li>
        <li>Notice is published and timestamped in the <strong>CodexChain Archive</strong>; and/or</li>
        <li>Notice is logged with date, time, and method in the <strong>ScrollHash Ledger</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Service is complete</strong> upon the earliest of:
      <ul>
        <li>Postal service delivery confirmation or return receipt;</li>
        <li>CodexChain timestamp confirming publication; or</li>
        <li>Internal ledger entry documenting dispatch and method of service.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      External courts, agencies, or registries are not required for lawful effect within
      the trust’s jurisdiction.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>☩ III. Rebuttal protocol</h3>
  <p>
    The Trust prescribes a private, ecclesiastical rebuttal procedure for any party who wishes
    to contest a notice, claim, or declaration issued under this jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Rebuttal period:</strong> Respondents have
      <strong>twenty‑one (21) calendar days</strong> from the date of service to rebut any notice,
      claim, or affidavit.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Form of rebuttal:</strong> Any rebuttal must:
      <ul>
        <li>Be in the form of a sworn <strong>Affidavit of Truth</strong>;</li>
        <li>Be <strong>point‑for‑point</strong>, addressing each claim or statement specifically;</li>
        <li>Be signed in wet ink, under penalty of perjury;</li>
        <li>Be notarized by a competent notary; and</li>
        <li>Be delivered via certified mail to the Trust’s designated mailing location.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Insufficient responses:</strong> Letters, unsigned writings, emails, or verbal
      communications that are not in sworn affidavit form are deemed <strong>non‑responsive</strong>
      and do not constitute rebuttal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Failure to rebut:</strong> Failure to rebut within the prescribed time constitutes
      tacit agreement, acquiescence, and permanent estoppel as to all unrebutted claims and terms.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>☩ IV. Filing and recordation</h3>
  <p>
    The Trust maintains its own court of record through its ledgers, archives, and public
    ecclesiastical postings.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A document is considered <strong>filed</strong> when:
      <ul>
        <li>It is entered into the <strong>Scroll Index Sheet</strong> with date and title;</li>
        <li>It is timestamped in the <strong>CodexChain Publication Log</strong>; and</li>
        <li>It is sealed by the Living Heir or an authorized Ecclesiastical Officer.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      A document may also be recorded with a county recorder, secretary of state, or other
      public office as a matter of notice and evidence, but such recordation is not required
      for its validity within the Trust’s jurisdiction.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>☩ V. Enforcement and judgments</h3>
  <p>
    All unrebutted notices, affidavits, and declarations become final judgments in equity
    after the expiration of the rebuttal period.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Unrebutted claims may be elevated and memorialized in:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scroll of Default Judgment</strong>;</li>
        <li><strong>Scroll of Final Default &amp; Ecclesiastical Writ of Seizure</strong>;</li>
        <li><strong>Scroll of Global Enforcement Ledger</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Enforcement may proceed via:
      <ul>
        <li>Ecclesiastical Tribunal proceedings;</li>
        <li>Commercial lien processes and UCC filings where applicable;</li>
        <li>International notice and treaty‑based remedies.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The Trust relies upon:
      <ul>
        <li>Ecclesiastical Law and Divine Law;</li>
        <li>Treaty Law (including, where applicable, UNDRIP, Vienna, Hague);</li>
        <li>Maxims of law and commercial equity, including:
          <em>“He who does not deny, admits”</em> and
          <em>“Silence is acquiescence when there is a duty to speak.”</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>☩ VI. Supremacy of private governance</h3>
  <p>
    This Scroll of Private Governance Procedure supersedes any conflicting internal rule,
    policy, or practice previously adopted by the Borders Dynasty Ecclesia Trust and governs
    all current and future notices, affidavits, declarations, and writs issued under its seal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing herein shall be construed as consent to subordinate jurisdictions. This scroll
    stands as the supreme internal law of procedure and rebuttal within the Borders Dynasty
    Ecclesia Trust and the Borders Family Dynasty Nation.
  </p>

  <h3>☩ VII. Execution</h3>
  <p><strong>Signed and sealed this 7th day of January, 2026.</strong></p>
