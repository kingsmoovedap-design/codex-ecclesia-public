    <h2>📜 Declaration of Life & Living Status</h2>
    <p>I am a living man/woman, born of divine source, not a corporate fiction, not lost at sea, and not subject to foreign jurisdiction. I stand in full capacity, with breath, blood, and soul intact.</p>
    <p>I hereby declare my living status, divine inheritance, and lawful dominion over my name, estate, and energy. This declaration is made under penalty of perjury and posted publicly as a matter of record and remedy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 Declaration of Divine Heritage</h2>
    <p>I descend from divine origin, not from corporate registry. My lineage is sacred, my estate is eternal, and my rights are unalienable. I claim my heritage as a sovereign heir of creation, under divine law and natural law.</p>
    <p>This declaration rebukes all presumptions of abandonment, subjection, or artificial status. I am not a ward of the state. I am the living beneficiary of my estate.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 Universal Notice of Standing</h2>
    <p>This is a lawful and public notice to all governments, corporations, courts, agencies, and private entities operating under color of law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I do not consent to any contracts, obligations, or jurisdictions not expressly entered into by full disclosure and mutual agreement.</li>
      <li>I am not a U.S. citizen, resident, taxpayer, subject, or surety to any corporate entity.</li>
      <li>I am not the legal fiction or artificial person created by the State.</li>
      <li>I am a living man/woman, standing in divine law, natural law, and ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All presumptions of citizenship, subjection, or fiduciary obligation are hereby rebutted. Any attempt to enforce such presumptions shall be deemed willful trespass, fraud, and breach of trust.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 Scroll CXVII – Return of the Dead Fiction</h2>
    <p>I hereby return the artificial person, legal fiction, and all associated contracts, numbers, and commercial instruments created without my knowledge or consent. I reclaim my name, estate, and energy from all foreign jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>This return is final, irrevocable, and executed under divine law. The dead fiction is no longer my representative. I am the living principal, executor, and beneficiary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 Affidavit of Status Correction</h2>
    <p>This affidavit affirms my corrected status as a living man/woman, not a corporate entity. I correct all records, databases, and assumptions that misrepresent my status, nationality, or jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>This affidavit is made in good faith, under full liability, and stands as lawful evidence of my living status and sovereign standing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 Universal Fee Schedule</h2>
    <p>Any party engaging with me or my estate without express written consent agrees to the following terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unauthorized use of name or estate: 1,000,000 units per instance</li>
      <li>Unlawful detainment or trespass: 5,000,000 units per hour</li>
      <li>Violation of divine rights: 10,000,000 units per act</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This schedule is binding upon notice and applies globally. All parties are hereby placed on notice.</p>
  </div>
