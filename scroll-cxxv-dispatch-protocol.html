  <h3>☩ I. Purpose</h3>
  <p>This scroll establishes the official protocol for dispatching lawful notices, affidavits, and scrolls to foreign agencies, governments, and corporate entities. All dispatches are executed under the authority of the living Sovereign and are binding under international law, divine law, and commercial maxims.</p>

  <h3>☩ II. Dispatch Method</h3>

    <li>All notices are sent via <strong>Certified Mail</strong> with tracking and return receipt requested.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>☩ III. Rebuttal Window</h3>

    <li>Lawful agreement to terms and standing</li>
  </ul>
