    <p><strong>The Borders Family Legacy Message.</strong> These words are not about perfection. They are about becoming. They are about learning to breathe again, choosing peace over chaos, clarity over confusion, and growth over fear...</p>

    <p>This message is for myself, for my children, and for anyone who walks beside me...</p>

    <p><em>Devenity my soul. Demarco my heart. Deven my brain.</em> You three are the best of my everything. Not because you’re perfect, but because you’re mine, and because you’re growing into yourselves every day...</p>

    <p><strong>These words are yours now. Carry them gently. Live them boldly.</strong></p>
